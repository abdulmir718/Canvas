# Canvas
For this project, I built a full-stack shopping cart website where users can browse and purchase art pieces. Users can click each painting for more information and then add them to their cart, if they choose. If the user decides they no longer want the painting, they can delete it from their cart as well. The cart screen shows how many items are in the cart and also calculates the users subtotal. The items are saved to the users local storage via Redux, so even if the page is refreshed or opened on anther tab, the cart items remain. This project utilizes React, Redux, Node, Express and MongoDB.
