# Canvas

For this project, I devised a scenario in where I was commisioned by an artist to create an e-commerce website where the artist will be able to display his paintings for others to view and purchase. The technoloies used to build this full-stack application include: React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.

- As a user, I would like to be able to browse all of the paintings the artists has created.
- As a user, I would like addition informaiton such as price, description, etc on an artwork I'm interested in learning more about.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to add paintings to my cart if I am intersted in purchasing them.
