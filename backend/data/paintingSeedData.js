    description: "This painting is part of a series on the diversity and ethnic richness of New York. New York continues to be a great melting pot of people within a larger community. It remains a mosaic; a montage of neighborhoods where certain groups predominate. Augustine worked on the representation of traditional ethnic enclaves, spread out like amoeba in adjacent communities. These various colors and flavors of people continue to emerge and combine into various geometric potentials.Little love scene from the 1950s ...

    description: "Spring comes, the reunion day, the traditional New Year of Vietnam this year is much different, the streets are quiet and romantic. No more crowded and noisy scene like previous years, Hanoi people are no longer hustle and bustle. The flower shop is no longer crowded, the flower beds are still colorful. Near Tet, the people of the province left this city busily to return home. Leaving a Hanoi after the silence and sadness hard to describe, very strange and very familiar ..Tet comes, perhaps only people from Hanoi of origin will stay in the city, Hanoians can feel a few days as a fresh Hanoi, a little sunshine, a Hanoi trembling to welcome Spring ...A very unique old town charm only comes when Xuan comes back in a lonely state ...Hanoi every time my heart is numb I rushed back to get it myself Even if it's just a little darkness on the street Even though it was just the afternoon of the fog.",

    price: 50000,
    description: "Augustine's mythological world-building is taken to its zenith in this large painting crowded with meaning and overlaid with layers and layers symbolism. Figures from world mythologies seem to radiate from the bombastic Slavic phoenix rising in the center to meet Beowulf grappling with the serpentine dragon, a warrior surrounded by a lamb above and an allusion to Henry Fuseli’s “The Nightmare” to the left. This polyphonic tapestry of vibrant colors woven into a collage of archetypical forms demands close attention of audiences who are encourage to return to this inexhaustible font of imagery.",

    description: "Chinatown in Bangkok is always worth a visit. Lively life day and night. You can buy almost anything, including what you don't need. In addition to the fantastic, adventurous food in the Chinese food stalls along the street. Augustine was also impressed by the overflowing atmosphere on the district's main artery, Yaowarat Road, over which large advertising banners in orange and yellow colors were stretched. Since Augustine could not understand the meaning that was written in Thai letters on the banners, he immortalized a Thai love poem in his picture in Thai Abugida characters",

    description: "'Imago' is the latest collection of works from Augustine. Continuing the path outlined in his works 'Chimere', the Artist moves towards more rarefied and dilated shores, where the tonal values unfold in a rich palette and the overall composition seems to dissolve, giving life to a painting that appears to be suspended between its final manifestation and its absence.",

    description: "The Lavender Fields, a sweet perfume. I breathe deep, relax. Inspired by the abundance of wild lavender on the hillsides, The Lavender Fields captures an early morning glow of a bruised purple landscapes. A soft lilac haze of flowers and twisted tendrils and crooked stalks. The sky is painted in deep greys and blues with glimmers of gold. Expressionist dripped paint suggests nature and its move toward chaos whilst the delicate lavender flowers bring focus and clarity to the artwork. The purple petals add a textured quality to the artwork and the delicate morning star flowers add a sharp contrast to the lilac glow. Dripped gold paint sits in the undergrowth in the painting and catches light bringing depth to the painting.",
